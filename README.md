# Visualizing online communities on social media
## MozFest 2022 Exhibit

In the MozFest Trustworthy AI Working Group's project on visualizing communities and subcultures on social media, we set out to create a visualization that captured the dynamic time dependence of interactions between communities on the Internet. The visualization below is a proof-of-concept of the kinds of dynamics and interactions that can be captured using a graph visualization. We focus on two COVID-related hashtags that parent groups have been using on Twitter - `#teamreality` and `#urgencyofnormal`. Each node represents a hashtag, and each edge represents the two connected hashtags apprearing in the same Tweet, with the frequency of how often the appear signified by the color and width of the edge.
